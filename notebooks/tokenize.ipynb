I stayed for 3 weeks during the pandemic and was so impressed with all the measures the hotel have put in place to keep everyone safe and well. They give you a box of masks, gloves and a bottle of hand sanitiser upon arrival, all the staff wear masks and gloves and the rooms and everything else are cleaned to the highest standard.  Plus the prices they've been offering during this time are incredible value for money! Definitely would recommend and hope to be back once travel reopens.   Thank you so much for looking after me so well until I could return home!\",\n",
       "  'Everything about this hotel was awesome. The staff made me feel welcomed from the minute i arrived until the day i departed. The view from the dining area with the mountains in the background was spectacular. The grounds were manicured to perfection with flowering plants in every direction. In the center of the pool / courtyard area was the largest bougainvillea i have ever seen. It was blue and in full bloom. I estimate it was 40 feet plus in height.  Fresh flower arrangements in the reception and dining area. The room was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. I travel extensively for business and pleasure. This in one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at, truly an amazing experience. The city of Antigua is beautiful, with a grand plaza, preserved buildings and churches',\n",

Very relaxing, we feel pampered and don’t want to leave!',\n",

I never want to leave when I stay at Hotel Antigua',\n",

Even helped me take some of my stuff to the room when she didn’t have to. She also helped organize my shuttle back to Guate Airport. I got a king-sized bed with a balcony that overlooks the arch and street. Excellent place and was quiet at night so you can rest. Price was excellent for the services rendered. ',\n",

In fact given its central location, just about every attraction in the town is accessible by walk. The place is a cosy nook with few rooms. That said, you can almost have their little lounge to yourself when you want. The rooms are tastefully done with Guatemalan textile and clean. The bed was comfortable as well. The only issue I had was the lack of ventilation. The room window opened to the steps just besides the room that would compromise my privacy but as I had mentioned, there are few rooms and very less people in the property so it was fine. The highlight of the place is the breakfast cooked by the\",\n",

I hope to stay here again when I come back to Antigua!',\n",

Since most of our tours were early in the morning, we missed breakfast three out of the four nights, but each morning they prepared a simple breakfast (ham & cheese sandwich, fruits & OJ) to-go so that we wouldn't go hungry. Very accommodating and flexible.  // Amenities - Airport shuttle service ($10/person), available both to and from the airport. They can also arrange transportation to other cities if you ask in advance. - Wonderful outdoor terrace upstairs, especially in the early mornings and evenings when the weather is cool. - Simple breakfast & purified water - Great location (close to tourist hotspots)  Overall, would highly recommend!\",\n",

Our group members were completely satisfied with their stay. The service was exceptionally accommodating. Since our three nights occurred over a period of 10 days while we volunteered and visited in other cities, they allowed us to store extra luggage between our stays. The rooms are a bit tight but the beds are comfortable. Some rooms have one bed, others have two, and some have a private bath and some shared. We preferred the two bed private bath option. It s a small hotel, with possibly ten to 15 rooms maximum. The included breakfast was satisfactory with fresh fruit and toast. Also',\n",

Totally unpretentious the staff have a genuine desire to ensure your stay is memorable.  ',\n",

It’s sooo yummy and really fresh, don’t miss it! It’s so nice getting such an awesome breakfast while sitting at that beautiful green terrace watching the volcano „Fuego“. The cleaning-/breakfast-ladies are really friendly, they even make your bed every morning and they clean the bathrooms/showers perfectly. Thank you for your absolutely wonderful work! The girls at reception are always helpful and friendly, thank you guys!

The showers are nice and hot.  There is a lovely breakfast included in the rate. We would definitely stay here again!',\n",

The breakfast is huge and varied and you can eat it on the roof terrace overlooking three volcanoes.  This is not a party hostel, good for couples or those trying to relax.  Nice hammocks on the roof terrace.  We did laundry with them for Q5 per pound and it was back the same day.',\n",

I left cheese in the minibar refrigerator and  since I was coming back to pick up my loggage  , just with a phone call staff inmediately took care of it .   I order room service for breakfast and was willing to pay for it even though that our expenses covered the breakfast at the restaurante. They did not charge for taking my breakfast to the room .   Other activities that we had in the hotel  , where excepcional since they have gorgeous outdoor spaces  . I recommend Santo Domingo not only as a tourist but to have Seminars or forums because they have the capacity in managing small and big groups. ',\n",

The restaurant on top of the mountain was a divine experience all the way around.  The hotel was the best I've ever stayed in and the grounds, museums, pool, and art were fabulous beyond my expectations. We were very pleased and will try to return next year to do it again. The only complaint is minor and just needed to be mentioned to someone.The location of the hotel seemed safe and secure and the room was excellent. \",\n",

The grounds are lovely, and our room was well appointed and very very clean (be sure to get one with a window, patio or balcony). Be sure to take advantage of visiting the onsite museums and ruins.  The staff is very very friendly and service oriented. Food was good, but they need some more \"casual\" options at dinner. The property was expensive by Guatemala standards, but coming from the US, affordable luxury.  We also visited the restaurant and museum at Santo Domingo del Cerro, up the hill from the hotel and had a delicious breakfast and enjoyed wonderful art installations. ',\n",

It is located very conveniently close to the famous yellow Arch in Antigua and just down one block from the town square, shopping, banking and restaurants. You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area. Even though there are stairs to haul your suitcases up and down, try to reserve room 10, 11 or 12. Those rooms have a balcony that you can watch Volcano Fuego erupt every night! There are several benches to sit on along the room\",\n",

They give you two bottles of water per day and I easily purchased more to use for cooking or brushing teeth etc, we had no issues as we stuck to bottled water. We ate at the restaurant a couple times, good food nice staff. We walked into town many times, it’s not far.

They do a lot of business with my company often so they already knew to have certain accommodations in place. The location is perfect. Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion.... Leave a night light at the entrance. My flight was at 6am so I had to leave at 4am. I was in room #18. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my way to the front.',\n",

The administration was helpful and available by text all the time. It was wonderful to have a full kitchen and washer/dryer during our stay. The apartment was perfect for our stay. It is a little off the beaten track so was quieter than the center of town but easy waking distance to everything.',\n",

The apartment is beautifully decorated, and the cherry on the cake was a bunch of fresh flowers and a huge bowl of local fruits on the dining table. Very comfortable bed, bath and kitchenette.

All-in-all, a perfect stay.',\n",

When I stay here I know that I only need go to Central Park to find the street - no turns to remember.  When you are there get out and explore, there are so many places to see and you should not feel you have \"seen\" Antigua by just going to two churchs, a ruin and a market.   I don\\'t always want to go out for breakfast, or dinner for that matter - and the Marques has a well equipped (with modern appliances!) kitchen so I can make meals or heat up my leftovers  if I want to, units also have a washer and dryer so I can do laundry.

Then you have to knock to get inside. This is not a bad deal for anyone staying there. The room was spacious and comfortable. I was on the second floor so if you have a heavy bag this could be a little difficult. The room had a comfortable bed, tv, bathroom, and a great view. The whole hotel area is a big garden. They also include breakfast, which is a perk. Eggs, beans, cheese, bread, and coffee for a delicious breakfast.',\n",

This adds to the style however as the rooms are wonderful and filled with character (ours even had a little show fireplace)   2 blocks from the main plaza and with very helpful staff (Nery was very attentive) I'd recommend choosing this hotel if you are in Antigua.   Breakfast was a little limited , but enough to get you through to lunch. Everyone was friendly.   The rooms were clean as was the hotel , and there is a rooftop view of Antigua where you can see Fuego spewing lava at night.   Really enjoyed our stay here. Stayed 6th to 8th of March \",\n",

It is probably a 3 to 3.5 star small \"hotel\", rustic, with a great location in the middle of town, close to all must see sites. Breakfast was very limited (scrambled egss, beans and one type of white cheese). But good value ',\n",

While most of the staff spoke little English the manager who was present each day was fluent.  The manager gave us information on tours and shops.  Breakfast was relatively simple but good.  Our room was not very large but was well outfitted and the bed was comfortable.  We had no issues with hot water (there was plenty).Ask for a second floor room, they have  view of Fuego ( an active volcano).   There were no negatives during our 4 night stay.  The hotel is a bargain.  We would stay there again. Stop for diner and music at the Santa Clara Cafe only a block away.',\n",

The rooms and lounge are decorated with antique style furniture. ',\n",

My room was also gorgeous- every detail was beautiful. Even the doors were carved with a floral design. The staff is very helpful.  The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\",\n",

My boyfriend and I had a junior suite on the second floor with a great view of the volcano when we stepped outside our door.The room was clean, had great natural light and a fireplace. King sized bed was comfortable and actually big enough for my 6'3'' boyfriend to fit in. WiFi signal strength in rooms was strong. Location was great. Within walking distance from the central park and the walk home late at night never felt un-safe. The staff was incredibly friendly and always willing to help with directions and/or advice. The breakfast in the courtyard/garden every morning was fantastic! Great choice for the price.\",\n",

I would recommend this place to my family and friends.  The only issue is, the morning and afternoon traffic from Antigua to GUA can be quite heavy, up to two hours.  Keep this in mind with flights, as I missed one of mine.  ',\n",

It's quaint, quiet and relaxing but you also have access to the larger resort across the street so can enjoy some additional amenities like restaurant, bar and pool (but Casa Encantada also has a pool!). The room was small but we never spend much time in the room when exploring a new city so that doesn't matter. It was well decorated and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly as well! The breakfast on the rooftop was also delicious and it was so nice to soak up the sun on the rooftop every morning. You can pretty much walk all of Antigua so the location is perfect and not on a super busy street. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Antigua!\",\n",

However, we had to close our windows because of the mosquitos and our room got pretty stuffy. Maybe they could have a few portable fans available.

It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain. There is also a rooftop where we sipped wine before dinner.   We were in room 3 and my suggestion would be to avoid rooms 1 thru 3.',\n",

One suggestion would be a water cooler in room. The two small bottles provided were not enough.

They helped us with whatever we needed and answered all our questions. The daily breakfast is served to order and in a room next to the kitchen with five tables. Although the choices are limited to either the traditional eggs, beans, cheese and fried plantains or the pancake and fruits platter, it was something that we looked forward to and enjoyed.

It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet. We walked all over the town - even the main market was about 15 - 17 minutes on foot.  We had to go to the bank in the Central Park a couple of times, but it was within ten minutes.  Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \",\n",

They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.

As I was already awake, this wasn’t an issue. You can hear street noises until about 9 pm when it starts quieting down.   The room itself was great. Bed was a tad bit on the harder side, but not a big deal. Pillows were soft and fluffy. Plugs in several spots in the room. Window opens to provide some ventilation.

It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.',\n",
       "  \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\",\n",

I stayed with my daughter and son-in-law in a spacious room with 2 double beds.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Our bathroom was down the hall, and there was never a problem with having to wait etc.  Great hot water!  We ate at the downstairs restaurant a few times, and it was always delicious.  Our room was close to the upstairs bar/restaurant, and we could hear music at night.  However it wasn't a problem as it wasn't too loud or too late... and the music was good!  Very central hotel, the beautiful Antigua is right on the doorstep!  I would definitely stay here again.\",\n",

The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.',\n",

Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n",

In fact, to call it a hotel is in part a disservice, because that belies the beauty and history that pervades every corner of the expansive property. It’s like staying in an ancient ruins yet with the comfort and service of today. Surprises abound, including thousands of flickering candles nightly, to fresh coffee and pastry discreetly placed in each hallway nook each morning.  The employees are top notch as well, from the initial bell stand interaction, to reception, restaurant, gym, housekeeping, security...you get the picture.

It is kind of a townhouse complex where you can rent individual units. We decided for this place because it is located just 4 blocks from the Central Park and several restaurants with all types of food. Our experience was much better than staying in a hotel.

The only cons I found are its location, it is a bit far from the center of antigua only because you have to walk everywhere and it rains alot. The other con is noise control.

Tourists must keep in mind that Antigua is a colonial city, you will not see signs over hanging the streets, the properties have names on them and this is how you locate them.  Although we entered Antigua during the night we were able to find El Marques quite easily, when we drove up the security guard checked a list to make sure we were on it before opening the gates to allow us to enter.

       "  'Stayed 2 nights in early April 2019. Property is impeccably well maintained and clean. Small hotel and facilities. Reasonably private and saw few other guests. Suite room was spacious but not particularly luxurious. Location was reasonably central, there is some noise from buses/trucks but by no means loud. However, I felt for the price there are many similar options in Antigua.',\n",

The hostel itself was very clean, the beds in the dorm were comfortable and provided a lot of privacy due to curtains around every bed.

Don't worry, it's safe!  Actually there's no volcano view from the property, but it's the first thing you see when you go out. There's a small parking, I suppose it's free for guests. Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\",\n",

The location is slightly out of the centre but only a 10 minute walk to everything interesting and very close to the Mirador.   We had a taxi booked in the middle of the night on our 4th night, and the owners kindly let us leave bags with them all day and nap on their couch until it arrived so we didn't have to pay for an extra night.   Definitely stay here if you want to be out of the busy traveller hostels and really relax!\",\n",

The price is reasonable for Antigua--we find bang for the buck to be much higher generally in Mexico, but... you're in Antigua!  Breakfast was included and adequate.  Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.  Cannot recommend the shuttle van their lobby travel agent booked us on to Lake Atitlan--they put 13 in an 8 person van, a hellish 3 hour ride with no potty break!  Ack!\",\n",

This hotel is old which adds to all the charm! But it can be noisy with breakfast starting in the morning, or just people coming and going if you stay in the front courtyard where the breakfast is served. Which is wonderful and some of the best coffee in our stay in Guatemala. We took a beer up to the rooftop for a great way to end the evening!

The rooms are adequate size, clean and quaint too, with plug points - USA 3 prong adapter size.) There was a hairdryer in the bathroom too. Also, use of a safe inside the room was FOC... great!  The only niggle about this posada, is that noise from one room to the next travels through the walls.

There were seating areas all over the hotel. As the rooms can be a little dark (great for sleeping), these areas are a nice place to read and relax. The staff, super helpful!

I have traveled extensively in Latin America and can say with confidence that this is one of the nicer accommodations in Antigua.  It is gated from the street, which is typical, and adds to a sense of privacy as well as security.  The staff was very kind, and although not English-speaking, none the less pleasant and helpful.  The hotel is immaculate and the courtyard is somewhere I could imagine sitting for hours.  It was just lovely and filled with trees, flowering plants, birds, and a fountain.  The breakfast was decent; I won't complain because it was included and food is not exactly cheap in a touristy area such as this.  Very convenient location and lovely,\",\n",

We asked for a restaurant that was close by and \"economically priced\" (i.e. cheap) they recommended Rincon Tipico (was great btw). The room was cute and clean but the bathroom wasn\\'t so great. The shower stall and toilet are separate and the doors are flimsy. Taking a shower was difficult because the water kept leaking out.   I never saw or are at the breakfast buffet (as described). Didn\\'t know it existed. The staff refered us to a restaurant next door.   The pool is not heated as described, either.  Aside from that, the service waa great and the views are incredible.

Most of the processions passed in front of the hotel and we had two rooms on the second floor, each with a balcony to enjoy an expectacular view.  My advice is to reserve early to get these rooms.  The rooms were clean and the showers had hot water. The Staff were very attentive and they took care of washing our clothes. Rafa, the owner, was very pleasant and helpful in arranging our transportation back to the airport and also offered some tapas for snacks.  The breakfast was delicious and served in the patio, where you meet other guests.  I will definitely stay here again.  One of many nice features of this hotel is that is in the center of town and a few steps from the Central',\n",

If economy is your greatest concern or you want a contrived resort experience, this may not be your fit. If you enjoy accommodation that allows you  interaction with  your host and an attentive but small staff in an attractive environment, this is an excellent choice.  ',\n",

As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport.

Have to turn the handle slowly and wait for a while. Found out the second day there. And if hot, you just need to ask for a fan. \",\n",

There is a kitchen present (not very common around here) and they do laundry relatively cheaply, or you can wash your clothes by hand and they have a drying line on the rooftop terrace. Every room is either lockable or they have lockers in the dorms, so all your valuables can stay safe.  A tip: if you take a bottom bunk in the dorm, you get privacy curtains :D They were fully booked on Halloween night so we unfortunately had to stay at another hostel for that night, but we came back and were welcomed like old friends.

The hotel is just blocks away from Park Central and close to the arch, as well.  It is a very well located hotel.   The hotel has a beautiful courtyard with a lovely fountain and each night around 5:30-6:00 o'clock the birds would arrive and serenade us.   The only drawback was that there wasn't always hot water.

The shower was odd and made me feel uncomfortable, but it was my fault for not complaining about it. I dealt with it for two nights being that I wasn’t there for the hotel, I was there to explore the area.

This time, we traveled with our one year old daughter, to whom the staff was very accommodating.  All staff members were very helpful (almost entirely in Spanish, but many were also apparently quite comfortable speaking a small amount of English).

It is a twenty minute walk to the plaza which I liked because we were close enough to go, but far enough away to feel more secluded. The food was amazing. The staff was always professional and attentive. The rooms are simple, yet always well maintained. When I say simple, I do not imply it lacks any modern conveniences. A good Latin hotel will have a hot shower, tiled floors and a comfortable and cable TV. I would stay here again in a heart-beat!',\n",

It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.

       "  'We spent a week in Antigua, Guatemala with Casa Encantada as our domicile. We were very warmly greeted and impressed by the old world elegance of the Casa. It was well kept and very nicely appointed. Our room was essentially in a garden with fountains, plants and singing birds. We had a comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. Though there were times in the morning when the commuter traffic was a little noisy, our stay was comfortable and relaxing. Most of all, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. I have no problem in recommending Casa Encantada.',\n",
       "  \"Our trip was to hike Acatenango and we wanted a room that would be comfortable and convenient. We ended up with so much more! The room was clean and comfortable. Nothing flashy but well appointed and everything worked well. The surprises were the second floor terrace with the included breakfast (every morning) and the friendly staff. The terrace was a great place to relax and enjoy breakfast, the sunshine, relax, and/or read.  Everyone was so nice. We were always greeted with a smile. The hotel is convenient to the center of the city. They also can plan spa's at the much more expensive hotel across the street. So even though they did not have their own spa, it was almost better as we did not have to pay the higher hotel prices. Also, if your into yoga, there is a great studio\",\n",
       "  'This a a quaint hostel in Antigua that was exactly what we were hoping for when we arrived. The staff is very helpful and kind. They even held our large suitcases when we went on a trip outside Antigua for a few days. Great hostel in this process range.',\n",
       "  'Very clean with a great location.  I stayed in a mixed dorm for three nights and slept well. Hostal Antigua is perfect if you would like a quiet place to lay your head. Don’t expect to meet traveling companions here, though. Maria is extremely helpful, with suggestions on where to eat, bank, shop and take Spanish language classes. ',\n",
       "  'We stayed in the double room with private bath, and could not fault Hostal Antigua. We also organised several shuttles with the hotel, all of which we found easy, reliable and economical. The staff are wonderful, and even let us check I. early (lucky us) at 10.30 am, after a long overnight trip from Flores (I did let them know this in an email if you’re thinking this sounds good)!  Would definitely stay there again, considering how clean it was, and the hot shower, comfy bed + great price!  ',\n",
       "  'It was clean and the staff is very nice. Not all of them speak english perfectly but for me as a non Spanish speaker it was still easy and nice to communicate. The location is just fine with breakfast, lunch and dinner options around the corner. It also has a night guard on duty, opening the front door for you when coming “home” late. You can pay cash and with credit card which is not very common in Guatemala. Would go there again.',\n",
       "  'Stayed here for 3 nights, 4 friends staying in 2 rooms. The location is perfect, right in the centre of the city and the hotel is  full of  character. There are some lovely touches , making one feel as though one is staying in a private home....and the welcome is warm and friendly. The roof terrace is great for relaxing. Breakfast was tasty and well  prepared . A hotel to recommend. ',\n",
       "  'The staff here are very friendly and efficient although a slightly more lively greeting each time you come in to the hotel would give an even better impression. It’s a really quaint hotel with beautiful flower arrangements all over.  The breakfast is served in the pretty courtyard - great muesli , fruit, yogurt and hot food.  From the rooms it’s really easy to hear people next door and bells ring nearby at 5am but it’s an old building so it’s all part of the ‘charm’.  From the roof you can see the volcano spewing its smoke at times. The hotel is in a good location with easy access to all the main sites.  We thought there was a bar downstairs but there wasn’t. However they sent out for some! ',\n",
       "  'We stayed here for a one night visit to Antigua. The hotel was very comfortable, with wonderful sitting areas and beautiful flowers throughout. The room was clean and comfortable and very nice bathroom good shower pressure. Service was great, we had a pickup organized for the airport via the hotel desk and breakfast served in the morning included with our stay. I would definitely return to Hotel Meson de Maria!',\n",

The crisp bed linen, the airy bathroom with a glass ceiling so you can see the blue sky when you are having a shower. The packed breakfast when we left at six for a trip out. The coffee and cake served at 5pm. The tables , chairs and sofas dotted around the terraces for comfort. The extra mile that staff took in booking us transfers and tours. Thank you so much for a lovely stay. Helen and Bill, Feb 2019',\n",
       "  'The Euro Maya Hotel is easily the best hotel in Antigua, Guatemala. The interior decorations are incomparable and give the entire hotel a quaint, homely vibe. The staff is amazingly accommodating and rapidly responds to any requests. Both the staff and the hotel never fail to make you feel welcome. The food in the pleasantly sized restaurant on the upper level is superb; perfect portions, great taste, and filling just enough. The maids always clean the rooms in a timely manner and do the sweetest little things like folding the clothes and towels that were left on the floor. The best part of the hotel is the open roof which you can see from the lobby; some rooms have balconies so you can look up and see the sky. The hotel also includes a lounge/dining area with a huge waterfall',\n",
       "  'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n",

It is a lovely hotel and the rooms are clean, bright and roomy. The staff is very friendly and although we had to wait some time for the room to be cleaned after we checked in it was well worth it. Aside from this the location, the prize was very reasonable!',\n",

Breakfast to go was arranged for our trip to the volcano, including his great Argentinian empanada's :). Rooms are clean, spacious and cool with a comfy bed and separate wifi for each room. Tasteful breakfast in the lovely quiet patio. Definitely a great place to go in Antigua (actually it was the nicest casa we stayed in Guatemala), highly recommended! Thanks Rafa :)\",\n",

We stayed in room 5 which would be great for a family - bunk beds in one room and two queens in the main room.  Room 5 is located in the back of the hotel making it very quiet.  We did not hear any noise from the street.  The upstairs terrace is very peaceful and comfortable, a very enjoyable place to hang out.  When the sky is clear, there is a nice view of the volcano.  Breakfast was very good, served to your liking.',\n",

The location is excellent-- just steps from the central square, the beautiful Arch, restaurants and shopping!  Rafael (the owner) was the most pleasant, accommodating, helpful person and literally went over and above to make us feel at home and attend to our needs!  We were on a medical mission and needed sack lunches each day and he had them ready by 6:00 am and packed in his children's lunchboxes to keep them cool!  He even called us one night on the phone to let us know that the volcano was erupting because he knew we didn't want to miss it!

It was very spacious and the beds were comfy, even the bunk beds.  The room was also spotless.  The family room was a bit noisy. It worked ok for us since we are early risers but if you want to sleep in I would recommend selecting a different room. I was also expecting a bit more from the private patio.  Unless you need the extra space I would recommend getting a room with a balcony on 5th.   The breakfasts were delicious with an excellent selection.

       "  \"My sister and I stayed at Hotel Casa del Parque recently and we had a wonderful visit. The hotel is very centrally located, within a few steps to the central park (where many restaurants, cafe's and shops are located) and artisanal markets. The staff were very friendly and helpful, directing us to the best place to exchange money, and helped us to arrange transportation to the airport. The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing. The upper level has a great view of nearby ruins and the volcano, but we had a room on the lower floor and it was still great, with a view into the courtyard filled with plants and a fountain.\",\n",

It had everything I needed to be comfortable and the fan kept the room cool even without air. The room was very clean and was very close to the water tank to refill bottles. I loved everything about Casa del Parque but the thing I loved the most was the staff. They let someone else drop my bags off and took them to my room since I couldn't get there to check in til late. The gentleman at the front desk designed a safe morning running route for me and gave me other suggestions of active things to do and a lovely lady at the front desk helped me book a shuttle back to the airport effortlessly. The ambiance was perfect and for once on a vacation\",\n",

The price was quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. Breakfast was continental but for the price I paid I didn't expect a feast. Wifi only worked in the courtyard, the signal was too weak in my room. All in all, a great stay.\",\n",

It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n",
       "  'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town. ',\n",

If location is your primary concern, this may not be your best option. I would still give this place 5 stars because of the helpfulness of the staff.   We arrived in the evening and had a 4am shuttle to Honduras the next day so our time here was limited, but the staff were so friendly and ordered a Chinese delivery (Restaurante Mulan) for us for dinner. The room was also comfortable and the shower was a perfect temperature - important after a few days in the Guatemalan highlands where the water was lukewarm at best! This place was ideal for a short stay.',\n",

The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\",\n",

Large grounds with exotic plants and a swimming pool at the far end with lounge chairs. You walk through a small court yard and then there are the rooms. Very modern bathrooms and very clean.  Excellent beds and everything is clean. The hotel looks like it could have been a Spanish Estate and then turned into a hotel. I had dinner there and breakfast. Excellent food and attentive restaurant staff. The restaurant looks over the garden area, nice touch. Its about a 15 minute walk to the town. This is a very pleasant walk past old churches and lots of old buildings and shops. What a beautiful town. It looks like they dropped a Spanish city in Guatemala.',\n",

Walking distance to town.\",\n",

Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n",

The staff is helpful and the property itself is gorgeous having left many of the original walls from the monastery. They've done an incredible job with the grounds full of plants and even parrots who hang out in the courtyards during the day. The restaurant is good but expensive for Antigua (as is to be expected with a hotel restaurant). I highly recommend staying here!\",\n",

As soon as you walk in, you understand that you are somewhere special, especially when you walk in at night. Almost mysterious, the candles, the sculptures, the patina, the history, a choice of music. It is like a museum where you were allowed to sleep. Staff is really great and friendly, however some of them did not speak English too well and it is strange given it is a 5 star hotel. On the same note the restaurant's staff is also very kind and really trying their best, but we had to wait for some silly things, that in theory shouldn't happen to a 5 star property. However, given it is Guatemala, we were totally OK with that. Apart\",\n",

There is a big wood door that is kept closed all day and night. But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do',\n",

Guests can use the amenities of the other hotels, including meals, swimming pool and gym in the other hotels at no additional charge.  My room, while quite lovely, was directly on a noisy street.  I innocently asked if my room could be changed. The receptionist not only worked to change my room, but went the extra distance to see if I could be relocated to the other hotel.  This meant that I was upgraded to a much more luxurious room, at no additional charge.  This is what I call true customer service!  I ate several meals at the hotel--the Porta--including sumptuous breakfast buffets as two dinners, which were all exceptional.  A delightful experience, all in all.',\n",

We really appreciated this.   Our room (no 1) was small, quiet, comfortable and very well equipped but we would have liked a bit more shelf space for our belongings. The bathroom was large with an enormous shower area.  The hotel is conveniently situated, quite close to the Parque Central and it always felt safe walking to restaurants at night.

It's a bit of a walk from the center... 10+ minutes, but seems to be on a peaceful, quiet street if you want to be away from the buzz. Great value for the money! We met friends in town so we didn't hang around the hostel too much to meet others. Owners are so sweet, they packed me a small lunch for my 4 AM shuttle!\",\n",
       "  'My fiancée and I loved this hostel. Our private, ensuite room was clean and lovely. The hostal has a view of a nearby volcano and serves excellent breakfasts included. It is very well located and has a nice climate. The Guatemalan owner, Christian, is a legend, speaks completely fluent English and Spanish and could not have been more helpful.',\n",

Very clean, very nice dorms and rooms (tried both), beautiful courtyard, delicious free breakfast, hot showers, close to everything. The family is very nice and helpful. We booked the Acatenango hike as well as a shuttle to Lake Atitlan with them and everything went smoothly. Highly recommend!!',\n",

The owner, Christian, speaks excellent English. He helped us book a tour to Pacaya volcano and also offer some great restaurant recommendations. The other staff aren’t as fluent but we were still able to get everything across that we needed.   The property is great. The hostal has its own garden and courtyard where you can just sit and relax and enjoy your free time.   The hostal allows guests to use their kitchen, so you can cook your own meals, or just cut up mangoes and pineapples like we did.   Our booking included breakfast. The options were pancakes or typical breakfast. Both were basic and',\n",

Excellent sized room, bathroom a little cramped and the shower head could do with being replaced (water really sprays out every which way), but nothing that stopped our stay from being very enjoyable.  Not the cheapest private room/bathroom in a hostel I've stayed in, but by far and away one of the best ones!  Staff/owners are lovely and very welcoming and helpful with information about the town, tours, hikes and shuttles/transfers...large resident dog is super sweet and friendly.  Loads of games and table tennis table and well stocked drinks fridge, but this is NOT a party hostel, don't stay there if that's what you're after...stay here if you don't mind being a little removed from\",\n",

I have been to Antigua several times, but this was my time at this hotel (which was recommended by a friend).  Everyone in my group had a great experience.  The staff (especially Jose) answered all our questions, the rooms were comfortable, and the location was excellent.

Our first floor room wasn’t that big, but was clean and comfortable with traditional colonial decor.  We found it quiet for sleeping at night.   The shower was really good - always a big plus for us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in the beautiful courtyard full of ferns and flowers, which can be a bit chilly  (my follically challenged companion had to wear his woolly hat!) but we were told there was an unusually cold front coming through!  Not a huge choice of food, but the fruit was excellent, and the traditional breakfast of eggs, plantain, salsa and refried beans was nice.  The hotel is centrally located so it’s easy to walk to all areas of Antigua',\n",

The staff was very friendly and the location is super convenient (just around the corner from the Santa Catalina Arch and 2 blocks from the Central Park).   Our breakfast was included and consisted of pancakes, potatoes, yogurt & fruit. We had booked a double deluxe room and requested a quiet room and were placed on the second level in the back of hotel (room 208), which was perfect for us. Keep in mind there are no elevators here. Wifi was decent and from the rooftop you can spot the three volcanoes surrounding Antigua. I’d definitely recommend this hotel!',\n",

When our \"taxi\" came, we realized that the owner Rafael himself had come to pick us up to take us to the airport! We are so grateful that he had woken up so early just to do us the favor! Thank you!  All the staff at Casa Del Arco are extremely friendly and helpful. A very helpful lady checked us in. On our departure day, even though it was 330am, a staff  was already awake and all ready to help me with my luggage.  Excellent wifi. Best we had in our 2 weeks in  Belize and Guatemala.  Hearty breakfast. I love the freshly squeezed OJ.  I love the terrace with comfortable couches where I spent my afternoons',\n",

As we wandered into the b&b after 11 days of travel through the Yucatan and parts of Guatemala, our Agentinian host welcomed us with a greeting and a smile and helped us settle into marvelous spacious accommodations of solid wood,Guatemalan woven material, and sunlight. Throughout our stay he and his friendly staff truly made us feel at home and were helpful in every way.    There are four other reasons that I highly recommend Casa del Arco.  First of all, its second floor terrace with its hammock, swinging chair, sitting area and breakfasts-an excellent location to regroup after a day of exploration. Secondly, its bar and grill with a good selection of beers, tastey tapas, and awesome Agentinian sausage',\n",

We arrived late and our daughter, who had a bad stomach, hadn't eaten and was craving a soy-milk banana smoothie (she's a New Yorker, say no more). The lovely Argentinean host ran out to the supermarket, got soy milk and delivered a delicious smoothie to our room. So kind! Our family room consisted of a pristine, spacious room with two big double beds, a smaller room with bunk beds, and a bathroom. Comfortable beds, lovely white sheets, and so conveniently located right in the center of the city. Excellent value.\",\n",

Wifi router in every room so best wifi connection we had anywhere in Guatamala .Very enjoyable stay, highly recommended.',\n",

Somebody wrote that the rooms were the size of a broom closet where my half joking complaint about the Euro Maya Suites was it was such a long walk from the Master bedroom to the washroom as room 15 is enormous and is an actual suite with a king size bed and 60 inch flat screen for $50 US, Yes the rooms at the Euro Maya Hotel are smaller but they do charge less. to the reviewer that arrived on December 30th and complained about bait and switch, You arrived the day before New years Eve, you were lucky',\n",

There is a great lobby area, breakfast was served daily with our group (and was awesome) and the shopping, coffee shops, a gym, hostels and other interesting sites (old church buildings, market, etc) are all within 3 blocks.  The staff is outstanding.  They are always there when you need them but are not hovering too much!  Wifi is available and the restaurant/food service on site is excellent.

The beds with very comfortable with nice bedding and good pillows. Lovely flat screen TV's with Sky TV, so many many channels in English. Good, high speed internet. Not the strongest signal in our room, but excellent in the central courtyard.  A rooftop deck with some fabulous views. Not much furniture for sitting up on the roof deck.

The swimming pool is very clean and HEATED, which was great bonus since the temperatures where quite moderate in January. The staff of the hotel was amazingly welcoming, friendly and helpful. Thank you!!! Complimentary tea and coffee served 24 hrs is very nice. The staff even let us use the kitchen to prepare breakfast, which was also very nice. On our last day we decided to order breakfast in the hotel and it was very tasty, too. No restaurant, but there are many around.

Pool and gardens looked wonderful but was so busy we didn't get a chance to try it out.  Room was large and full of character.  I love interesting, different places and this was one of my favorites.

The rooms are clean, simple and comfortable, the wifi is a bit patchy but that is typical for Antigua. Breakfast is simple of toast, jam and fruit. It is good value for money and I would recommend this place to anyone for a traditional Antigua house to stay in. ',\n",

The entrance is authentic, with a patio and a fountain in the middle, and nice tables to catch the midday sun. It was a lovely surprise for us to discover the rooftop terrace and view on our last day, where we caught the sunset and a panoramic view of Antigua. Perfect for a couple of minutes of reading time or simply enjoying the time.   The hotel does not offer breakfast included, but you may request it. I recommend a delicious place less than a block away called Doña Luisa, where you’ll get both typical breakfast and international options.   The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the cathedral. Either way,',\n",

There's hot water all day and clean towels everyday if you need.  The kitchenette was fully equipped, which made it easy to fix light meals instead of getting takeout everyday.  All restaurants and a small supermarket are within walking distance.  The only downside...if party noise bothers you, not the base place to catch the best night sleep.  Since is so close to it all in Antigua main restaurants, the arch and parque central, you will catch the noise off the parties.  Mostly 'til 3am 😴😴 Other than that, we will be staying here the next second round to finish our Guatemala tour. 😉\",\n",

The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there.

Clean bath towels daily, but only one hand towel and one wash cloth for 3 people.   The package had us away for two nights out of the week. The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.

The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby.

We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience. Bottled water provided daily was appreciated. The location was good - walking distance to Parque Central and Caobo Farm. Overall, a good hotel and we had a comfortable stay.',\n",

Everywhere there were antiquities on display. Candles lit the grounds at night. The furnishing scattered around the hotel all were worth looking at closely.

       "  'especially the new connection to porta hotel Antigua. Its a plus to be able to use their pool and gym/dining as well.   Casa Encantda is well located - .  Clean rooms - pleasant size - makes this an obvious choice every time!  Great for small groups - The ONLY recommendation is to change doorbell ring - so, it doesnt sound throughout hotel every time someone is entering hotel.  ',\n",
       "  'We had our wedding catered with Porta Hotel Antigua and they had given us a complimentary night in the package, we were kind of bummed when we learned it was not going to be in Porta but in Casa Encantada (their boutique hotel) wow we were so wrong to think so! We decided to book the Suite for the rest of our stay and it was the best decision ever! Casa Encantada feels intimate and romantic, it\\'s located a couple of block away from the center and just around the corner from the large hotel Porta in case you want to make use of the heated pool and spa. The suite is was spacious and beautifully decorated, we made use of the hot tub and the chimney twice and had breakfast on the terrace while enjoying the beautiful views. We were able to use the terrace during our \"getting ready\"',\n",
       "  'Loved this place so much. The breakfast, the dog LUKA!, the beds, the showers, the places to sit, the receptionist guy. The only bad thing was we had to leave a night  because they overbooked, we were gutted !  Definitely stay here if you have the chance ! ',\n",
       "  'When we arrived at Hostal Antigueño, we were instantly impressed with the property. We were greeted within 30 seconds by the Owner/Operator named Christian, and he is the nicest guy in town. The atmosphere of the Hostel was definitely more relaxed the first night (Thursday), and the crowd picked up for the Friday/Saturday nights. However, it’s definitely NOT a typical “party“ Hostel. They do have a wide selection of cheap and delicious beers, and it’s a great vibe for hanging out but we always got a great night sleep as it tends to quiet down around 1030-11. Rooms were very clean with a big hot shower, and the beds were very comfy. Highly recommend this accommodation!',\n",
       "  'This is a nice hostel with two incredibly friendly hosts, Cristian and his partner. The rooms that we (my husband and I) stayed in were comfortable, clean and well presented. It’s not right in the centre, but Antigua isn’t huge so I didn’t find this a big problem. In less than ten minutes - if that - you’re in the main square. My husband’s Spanish school was just down the road too.   The breakfast is free and really nice: you have the option of three pancakes with syrup (which I’d describe as American in style), or scrambled eggs with a tasty black pean purée and bread (my favourite of the two). You also get free coffee and orange juice. Great value! The WiFi is strong too.   There’s a table tennis table and there are games such as jenga and playing cards.   The hosts gave us',\n",
       "  \"This place has a remarkably relaxed environment which matches the city's chilled vibe. We found this place just after new years and used it as base while we went and hiked the volcanoes. What made this place exceptional was the staff, headed by a gentleman named Christian. The service felt more like a hotel then a hostel with a great complimentary breakfast where they even catered to specific requests.Christian who owns the place couldn't have been more helpful. He was remarkably busy as it was close to new years but always took time to answer our questions and go a step further and offer help where he could. There are some people who do nice things because they want a trip advisor review and there are genuine people. He and his staff were genuine and a pleasure to stay with.\",\n",

A great upstairs terrace area and the best kitchen of any hostel I've stayed at. Only downside is the terrace closes at 9pm, but with such a great location there's ample bars etc within a few minutes' walk. Highly recommended. \",\n",

The property is well maintained with a cosy courtyard for breakfast and a rooftop with spectacular views (you can catch sunset). The wifi worked well throughout the place. Our room was a double on the second floor, away from the street noise and reasonably quiet at night. The staff was super friendly and attentive.\",\n",

The breakfasts were the best we had in a week in Guatemala! And Maria even came early one day to make us breakfast before an early departure. The hosts were pleasant and accommodating and willing to make recommendations. The only challenge was evening noise on the outside room; the inside ones are quieter. But there is no way to get this location without some noise, and for us the location was perfect. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!',\n",

The room was convenient and clean. Breakfast was very good and the personnel friendly and accommodating. We were pleasantly surprised to find this hotel close to the center of town that was also excellent value. I would highly recommend it to those traveling on a budget.',\n",

All hotels around here have there quirks and this on is no exception pipes are noisy and there is not glass in the windows that can be quite annoying when a gentleman from Texas decides to take a 5am phone call and stand out side of your room. But that being said the hotel and its court yards are absolutely amazing.',\n",

I moved on to another hotel in the area and was disappointed compared to Meson de Maria and I paid more for that hotel. Do yourself a favor and stay longer. I will next time I am in Antigua! The decor, courtyards, rooftop terrace are adorable. There is a peaceful vibe and the breakfast is a perfect assortment.',\n",

The only cons: mosquitos which I don't think any of us can avoid. I was so lucky to meet all these wonderful people in Antigua Guatemala. Also, so blessed that the weather was not bad at all during the stay. These staffs in this B&B are just like our family. They are lovely, caring and let you feel welcoming. I think this is the true meaning of hospitality. There are a lot of great things about this B&B and just cannot put them into words. I will just say, I will stay there if I go to Antigua again. If you stay there, have any questions about any arrangement or services, just\",\n",

For two days we had to leave the hotel at 6 am and had breakfast included, so the hotel provided a breakfast at that time, made by the doorman. Very sweet and charming!  Rooms are a bit different from each other. Check that!  Staff (apart from owners, that are there as staff too) are not \"prepared\" not good enough, and dont know how to solve problems.

The room had a nice balcony view with bathroom inside, always kept clean with fresh towels.  The breakfast was delicious, simple and satisfying which you can have right on the nice court yard with a view of the mountain.

Being an old restored Spanish-style house, it's possible to access to a central courtyard with good ventilation, at least from some rooms. The service is very good and the breakfast too. However, some aspects are not good, for example the outside noise, because the hotel is very close to the street and the external noises of public transportation are heard from early in the morning. I also heard every day a cock crowing at 5 am, but that was rather funny for me. While the rooms are big, the bathrooms are small and the shower is very uncomfortable. Wifi signal is only regular.\",\n",

There is a guard at night and you will have to show them the key to get back into the room, the guard doesn't speak as much English but is still quite nice. There is also a kitchen, a sitting room with dozens of books to read (mostly dated, many different languages, some are regional guide books), multiple sunny outdoor patios, and a pay per use internet cafe. Our room also had a TV, I didn't use it though. Not a luxury hotel but definitely an adequate base of operations.\",\n",

It’s surprisingly quiet at night given the central location. The service was excellent and the breakfast at Don Diego’s Cafe (included free) was delicious.

Unfortunately, breakfasts were not offered at all. Hotel staff recommended me a partner restaurant near Arco de Santa Catarina.

If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!! The wifi works really well and it's only a short 5 min walk into the Central Park and 900metres away from the lookout so great spot. \",\n",
       "  'I travel to Antigua each month on business and ALWAYS stay with Christian and Iris.  I can stay where ever I want, and I always want to stay with them.  They are special people, and the Hostal is a special place.  The atmosphere is quite, relaxing, and incredibly welcoming.  People from all walks of life and geographies sit around in the evening and share stories.  THE FIRE PIT ROCKS!  Also - the food is outstanding.  Talk with Christian about making one of his famous pizzas or enjoy more traditional Guatemalan dishes.  If you are looking for a place for you, you and your special someone or your famly - this is it.  Fun, but not crazy.  Energetic, but not over the top!  Hostal Antigueno is the perfect combination of energy and quite relaxation.',\n",
       "  'Hi everybody,  I can really recommend this hostel to have a great time in Antigua and not staying in a party hostel. The rooms (we took a two-bedroom) are really authentic and everything like shower or TV worked.  Moreover, the staff and also the owner Christian personally are very open and willing to help when you have any problems. In our case we had some health issues where he found a good doctor and also spend hours of time helping us with some language barriers there.   All in all, we enjoyed our time in Antigua, also because of this hostel.   Safe travels everyone. ',\n",

Everything about this place oozed with hospitality from the incredibly warm staff to the candles lit in the living room every night to the plates of cookies laid out in the evenings for the guests. We had the good luck of getting placed in room 7 which was behind the living room, across a little stone bridge over a small pond. It gave the feeling of being in a cottage with its exposed beam ceiling and vintage furniture. The use of the amenities of their sister hotel across the street is awesome, but the little plunge pool in the courtyard of Casa Encantada is also a great place for a quick cool down.   Breakfast on the roof',\n",

       "  'Casa Encantada was a great place to stay. It’s not far from the center of Antigua and I felt completely safe. The hotel is very small and you will not find the amenities of a larger hotel. But every person that worked the front desk greeted me by name every time I saw them, which is something you don’t normally get. The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n",

It was great for a family of 4. It is close to the centre, yet quiet at night. We also had use of the kitchen if we wanted and a washing machine (25Q for a wash and 25Q for the dryer). My only criticism was the thin curtains which meant an early start each morning - but it was good to be up early!',\n",

The rooms were beautiful with traditional Guatemalan furniture and both had french doors leading to an outside area to sit and relax.  The restaurant had wonderful food-we all enjoyed either steak or pasta as well as good wine.  The spa was amazing and I convinced my family to all get massages which they stated were one of the best they ever had.  The spa was gorgeous with huge hot tubs and a private pool for the spa attendees.  I would definitely stay here again especially for a romantic getaway as the property was gorgeous with the volcanoes as a beautiful backdrop.',\n",

The hotel is also a museum which is an amazing additional facility as walking through the hotel is truly fascinating. The staff is very kind, although less than 50% speaks basic English.

Our friends had their wedding in the on-site church, with a cocktail reception in the courtyard and the reception in the convention center.  Everything was just AMAZING!

Fresh juice, all sorts of fresh fruit, tea, coffee, choice of cereals, eggs/frijoles/platano all to order, decent bread and tasty jams. Wonderful.

The room was clean and well maintained and the roof was great for sitting and reading to just enjoy the beautiful weather. Finally, the location is perfect!

The breakfast with Augustine in the morning was wonderful up on the terrace, and if you want you can go across the street to the sister hotel for a breakfast buffet. Our room was very clean, comfortable, and despite the traffic outside the entire hotel was peaceful and quiet. I would highly recommend staying here!',\n",

The decor is quirky and old fashioned but we had plenty of space and everything was clean and comfortable. The shower was hot as long as you turn it up very gently. I enjoyed sitting on the roof early in the morning and watching the birds visit with the volcanos in the background. Breakfast was nice and the owner, Irma, could not have been more helpful. The location is great, being just a few blocks from the Parque Central.',\n",

The rooms are cozy and clean, the roof provides an amazing view of the volcanoes, and Irma cooked us a great breakfast each morning. The people at the hotel don't speak much english though, so make sure you're with someone who can communicate. Overall, Irma went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our time in Antigua by informing us of tours, places to shop, and events happening around town. Recently, she even helped me with a project for school by answering questions through an email\",\n",

The location is convenient, a short walk to the Central Park, the market and bus station, and all the shops, restaurants and attractions but just far anough away from the town center to avoid all the weekend chaos.  But best of all is the proprietor, Irma. She always serves a wonderful breakfast, is always happy to make arrangements for cabs and pickup at the airport, etc.; no matter what it is, she takes care of it for me.  Irma is very friendly and just a pleasur to chat with.     I highly recommend  it.\",\n",

We were able to pay in American dollars, and we were able to include the cab ride to the airport the next morning.  (A tip- tell them your flight leaves 30 minutes before it actually does.  Our cab driver was at least a half hour late picking us up, and we had a nail biting drive to the airport.

The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.  We accepted this as the trade-off for the excellent location.  You are a well-lit half block from the central square, so safe for going to restaurants and shops at night.\",\n",

The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything.

The hotel is located within an easy walk of Antigua’s main plaza and the city’s cultural attractions and many fine restaurants. As noted in other reviews, Casa Encantada is owned by the large Hotel Porta around the corner where you can enjoy the pool and take breakfast there too for a change of scenery.

Her breakfasts are delicious and she even packed bags for us when we left too early for breakfast there.

Perfectly positioned in town.  And it is an old home, which is one of the many reasons it's so wonderful in atmosphere, but that means it isn't soundproof.  If you need soundproof in that area of the world something recently built is necessary.  Though we only ever heard noise from inside the hotel.  There is no street noise at all.

I also so loved being able to walk around free wee museums to kill time and take in culture as I pleased. I also loved how close the hotel is to the main square and lots of activities.

Nothing in town is above a couple stories high and the architecture is a treat to enjoy throughout the city.

The only downside to our room was that the shower would not drain properly causing a very distinct sewage odor. In a small room and bathroom, this is not ideal.\",\n",

We arrived at 1 AM after a long delay and I had arranged a shuttle through the hotel from GC airport. I changed the arrival time about three times during the trip. Sure enough, our driver was there and we arrived safely at the hotel. Same for my daughter who arrived the next day.

While the casa is a good distance from downtown Antigua, it is easy to reach by taxi, and Lucia was more than happy to drop us off and pick us up each day in the Parque Central in her own car, across from the Metropolitan Cathedral.  Lucia was also gracious enough to drive us to the market on market day with her friend Nancy, and we learned SO much about Guatemalan culture and cuisine.

The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).

A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi.

From there, through an inconspicuous door, you reach a wonderful patio and the newer part of the hotel. We stayed in the suite of “Los Encuentros” over Christmas and New Year for a total of 15 nights.

The 3rd story is a great view of the volcanoes.  Rooms are small but clean and mattresses pretty good.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Tip: if you stay here they do not have screens in the windows; no problem though there are not a lot of bugs.  You will have a light curtain to keep this curtain closed bring a safety pin or a barrette will do in a pinch. We spent the last two nights there because we knew what to expect, no surprises\",\n",

The complementary breakfast was always filling and something different every morning. we also found that the location of los Encuentros was fairly central (it only took five minutes to walk most places) which made it much easier to get around. As two 20 year old girls there were times in Antigua that we didn't feel completely safe but we always felt secure while at Los Encuentros. If I ever get back to Antigua\",\n",

Hotel Los Encuentros is very safe and feels super cozy! Location is fantastic, near La Merced church. I highly recommend staying here. Price was a little higher than other hotels I looked at but definitely worth it!!!',\n",

Irma was more than helpful answering all of our questions about the city including where to get great authentic Guatemalan food.  From the moment we arrived until we left someone was always there to help us make arrangements for travel and to provide us with a safe and clean place to stay.  Irma's breakfasts were always better than anything we could have found in a restaurant, fresh and tasty. I'm going to keep this place in my list of hotels for my next trip to Antigua.\",\n",

There is also a pottery place close to the museum where you purchase candles and pottery items at a bargain price.

The squash purée was sweet and the fish was perfectly done . Many at our table also enjoyed pasta which was a large amount . The venue is also amazing it is steeped in history and I think I may need to come back in daytime to truly appear the old walls of the monastery .

Everyone was pleased with their rooms, two single rooms and the rest were doubles.  Each room was very clean.  We also had the kitchen available to use.

If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses.

Like everywhere else in Central America, the beds were harder than what we are used to in the US. However, you are not going to get fancy, imported, fluffy, foreign beds for this price. Sheets were clean and towels were provided.  We used the airport transfer, which was SUCH a convenience. The staff helped us book our bus to Atitlan, and they were able to watch our bags in the time between check out and our bus pick-up. There is a small courtyard in which to sit and drink beer',\n",

The only up was location close to cafe where i could get wifi which was apparently down in the area …..',\n",

Once the windows are closed there is no air circulation and the room becomes quite humid. Bed was reasonably comfortable, but the polyester blanket increased the discomfort caused by poor air circulation. The hottest the water got was tepid. Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was perfectly adequate.  There are no facilities for the secure safekeeping of passports and valuables.

We just felt like we were constantly getting ripped off by the place.

We wanted to switch the night we stayed to do the volcano with a friend and she said no then asked the next day if we were doing it that day (obviously it was too late).

The room was spacious but hot with only one fan in the room (a lot of the hotels don't have air conditioning). It's a great location but can be pretty loud because it's close to bars, but that can be a good thing if you plan to consume a lot of alcohol...you won't have far to walk.   Overall, Antigua is a great city and when I return I'll definitely stay at another hotel that's a little more upscale and offers breakfast and has a larger pool. \",\n",

In our first room, both the TV and shower were broken.  They brought in old sets until one barely worked.    The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.  She did seem upset, but this is a process that should work within any hotel.    On a minor note, the rooms are over-priced for what you get by Antigua standards. \",\n",

Our room was close to what I think was a staff room, and staff were very loud during the day and early in the morning.

We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise. Staff helped us arrange very affordable airport transportation and the free WiFi was pretty strong for Guatemala.

The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.  I am sure we could have secured a much better price if we had negotiated it upon arrival.',\n",

Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available. There are better alternatives in Antigua for less money, like the Juma Ocag, a lovely place.\",\n",

Location was good, few steps from the Parque Central. We booked private shuttle from the airport. They charge an additional fee of Q50 per every hour your flight is delayed. They warn about that when you book the shuttle and it is supposed to pay the additional hour of parking in the airport.

Common space is limited to a sterile rooftop with three tables and two sunbeds. Kitchen is also in the rooftop.

There's no courtesy taxi anymore as someone said in previous comments. I wouldn't advise you to walk there at night either...  - breakfast isn't great considering what you pay for the room: you get concentrated orange juice, coffee and a plate consisting of some scrambled eggs, frijoles, slice of papaya and watermelon. Pretty basic for £70 a night in Guatemala!  - if you're planning a visit to one of the volcanos or a\",\n",

And I mean hacking. There was no process, it was just a free for all, using the same dirty strip for entirely way too long which left me with a ton of wax all over. The walk home was so uncomfortable because the wax was rubbing all across my legs and cheeks.  She also didn't hold the skin down enough so the strip kept pulling my skin up which hurt a lot and was inefficient. The wax was obviously of super cheap quality. She didn't ask what shape I wanted for my brazilian, and she asked twice to see if it was okay shape, and it literally looked like a child drew a shape, it had no form, no clean lines\",\n",

We complained to management, who said they would talk to the group, but then did absolutely nothing.

Instead there are the more aggressive salespeople trying to sell various souvenirs at the front door.  When we checked in, there was no offer to have someone show us to our room.
